# Chatbot #

The ChatBot is a Python program that uses the **\`nltk\`** library to create a simple conversational chatbot. The chatbot is designed to respond to user input with pre-defined responses based on regular expressions.

## Getting Started

To get started with the ChatBot, follow the steps below:

Install Python: Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official Python website at https://www.python.org/downloads/.
Install NLTK library: The ChatBot uses the nltk library for natural language processing. You can install the nltk library using pip by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
```bash
pip install nltk
```
Download NLTK data: After installing the nltk library, you need to download the necessary data for NLTK. You can do this by running the following Python code in your Python interpreter or script:
python
```bash
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')
```
Clone the repository: Clone or download the ChatBot repository from GitHub at https://github.com/yourusername/chatbot. You can also download the code directly as a ZIP file.
Run the ChatBot: Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the ChatBot code is located. Run the chatbot.py file using the Python interpreter by running the following command:
Copy code
python chatbot.py

## How to Use

Once the ChatBot is running, you can start a conversation by typing in your input after the > prompt. The ChatBot will respond to your input with pre-defined responses based on regular expressions.

You can ask the ChatBot questions or make statements, and the ChatBot will try to provide relevant responses. If the ChatBot doesn't understand your input, it will display a default message asking you to rephrase your question.

To end the conversation, simply type 'bye' and the ChatBot will display a goodbye message and exit.

## Customizing Responses

You can customize the responses of the ChatBot by modifying the responses list in the chatbot.py file. The responses list contains tuples of regular expressions and corresponding responses. You can add, remove, or modify the regular expressions and responses to suit your needs.

For example, to add more responses, you can append new tuples to the responses list following the same format as the existing tuples. Make sure to define the regular expression pattern and the corresponding list of responses.

python
```bash
# Example of adding more responses
responses = [
    # Existing responses...
    (r'(?:What is your favorite food|What do you like to eat)\??',
     ['I am an AI and do not have preferences for food.']),
    (r'(?:Can you tell me a joke|Tell me something funny)\??',
     ['Why don\'t scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!'])
    # Add more responses here...
]
```
